## How to run [MacOS Only]
Get gmake
You can run this with `make` also.
```bash
brew install make 
```

This will create the build folder
```bash
gmake prepare
```


This will generate the files to build
```bash
gmake prebuild
```


Follow this commands to make the build. (Haven't figure it out how to do it from the Makefile)
```bash
cd build
gmake
cd ..
```

Run the program
```bash
gmake run
```
